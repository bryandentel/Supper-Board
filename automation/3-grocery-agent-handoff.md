# Step 3: handing the list to a shopping agent

Walmart has no public API for placing customer orders, so something has to drive the store's site or app. There are two ways to do this:

| Approach | How it works | Tradeoffs |
|---|---|---|
| **Shopping agent (what I use)** | An assistant that can shop Walmart for you picks up the list Claude saved and builds the order. I use Meta's Muse. | Runs in the agent's own cloud browser, so nothing needs to be on at home. You approve the order in the agent's app. |
| **Claude browsing your Chrome** | A scheduled task drives your signed-in Chrome through the Claude in Chrome extension and stops before checkout. | Your computer must be on, awake, and running Chrome at the scheduled time. More moving parts. |

I started with the Chrome approach and switched to the agent handoff because it doesn't depend on a computer at home.

## Message for the shopping agent

Paste this into your agent once and adjust the `[brackets]`. If the agent supports recurring tasks, it runs on its own each week. If it doesn't, the **Copy list** button on the board gives you the same list to paste by hand.

Hi [AGENT NAME], I'm changing how I handle groceries.

Meal planning, recipes, and dates are now handled by Claude through a shared board. You don't need to plan meals, write recipes, or choose cook nights anymore. If you have a recurring task for meal planning, please turn it off.

Your new job is just the [STORE] order:

Set up a recurring task for every Thursday at 7:00 PM [TIME ZONE]:
1. Look in my Google Drive folder called "Supper Board" for the newest Google Doc titled "Grocery order – Sun [date]".
2. Only continue if that doc was created today and its date is this coming Sunday. If there's no new doc this week, do nothing. I sometimes push my plan back, so some weeks won't have an order.
3. Build a [STORE] pickup order with exactly the items and quantities in the doc. Use my usual pickup store, and pick a Sunday afternoon pickup time, ideally between 1 and 4 PM.
4. [SUBSTITUTION RULES]
5. Don't place the order yet. Send me a summary first: estimated total, pickup time, any substitutions, and anything you couldn't find. Place it once I approve.

Please don't add, remove, or change items beyond necessary substitutions. If something on the list seems off, ask me.

If I paste a grocery list into this chat that starts with "Please build a [STORE] order", handle it the same way.
```

## Tips

- The agent needs access to the same Google account as the Drive folder. A quick check is to ask it, "Can you see a folder called Supper Board in my Google Drive?"
- Keep the "send me a summary first" step, at least at the beginning. Odd substitutions are easy to catch there.
- Claude saves the list at about 5:50 PM and the agent runs at 7:00 PM, which leaves a buffer.
